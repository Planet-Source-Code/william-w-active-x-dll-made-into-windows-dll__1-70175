parts of the addin code were a dll maker though much more complicated (and less developed)
than this version 
I just tweaked it and added my own code to make a .def file maker add-in

but I'll Still give some credit as this was my starting point

simply compile this add in to the VB98 Directory (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\)
Restart VB and it will be under add-ins

you don't have to have this Add-In but it makes the .def files for you

And now makes a declare helper text doc listing function/sub input/output params
---------------------------------------->
NOTE: you need to save your project first and have a make name to use the make declare helper properly
---------------------------------------->
oh Btw for some reason vb-ide crashes when you close an add-in project?
?? but its not a big deal it doesn't do it on any other project
